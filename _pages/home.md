I am an astrophysicist and postdoctoral researcher working at the [Institute of Theoretical
Astrophysics (ITA)](http://www.astro.uio.no)at the [University of Oslo
(UiO)](http://www.uio.no), in the field of extragalactic astronomy. I am mainly
interested in the properties of the interstellar and circumgalactic gas in
star-forming galaxies, and how they evolve over Cosmic time. To learn about
them, I mainly use spectroscopic data from a number of world-leading facilities
like the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.spacetelescope.org/), the ESO
[Very Large Telescope](http://eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/vlt-instr/x-shooter/), or the [Magellan Telescopes](http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/Magellan).

I completed my Ph.D. from the department of astronomy at [Stockholm
University](http://www.astro.su.se) and the [Oskar Klein Centre for
Astroparticle Physics](http://okc.albanova.se), Sweden, in December 2016. My
Ph.D. advisors were [Göran Östlin](http://ttt.astro.su.se/~ostlin/) and
[Matthew Hayes](http://xayes.org/pub/). My work here was focused on the
properties of strongly star-forming galaxies at low or moderate distances from
Earth.

I got my Master's degree from the [DARK Cosmology
Centre](http://dark.nbi.ku.dk), supervised by [Johan
Fynbo](http://www.dark-cosmology.dk/~jfynbo/), in 2011.
