# About me

![Me at the NOT](/images/MigVedNOT_crop.jpg){: .align-left}

I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Oslo
(UiO)](http://www.uio.no), at the [Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics (ITA)](http://www.astro.uio.no), where I work on spectroscopic analysis of interstellar and circumgalactic gas in gravitationally lensed galaxies in the group of Prof. Håkon Dahle.
