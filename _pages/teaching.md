## Computer tools for astronomers ##

For the third year, this fall I am offering the 3â¨‰3 hours worksop: **Computer
Tools For Astronomers**. The workshop contains an introduction to the
Linux/Unix **command line**, to the $\LaTeX$ document preparation system and,
not least, to **Python**-based tools for computations, data processing and
visualization.

You can download the [zip archive] with slides, templates and notebooks.

### HTML notebooks

I have put up passive HTML renditions of the IPython notebooks presented during the workshop, for those who just want to view the notebooks without running IPython:

+ [numpy arrays]
* [plotting] with Matplotlib
+ Working with [FITS files]
+ [Fitting] with `lmfit` (one of several packages available)
+ Some useful [Astropy] packages


The materials are from last year (2014) and are likely to be altered before the
workshop this year.
