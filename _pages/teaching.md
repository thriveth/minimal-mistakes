## Computer tools for astronomers 

In 2013, 2014 and 2015, I offered the 3â¨‰3 hours workshop: **Computer Tools For
Astronomers**, on Stockholm University. The workshop contains an introduction
to the Linux/Unix **command line**, to the $$\mathrm{\LaTeX}$$ document preparation
system and, not least, to **Python**-based tools for computations, data
processing and visualization.

You can download the [zip archive] with slides, templates and notebooks.


### HTML notebooks

I have put up passive HTML renditions of the IPython notebooks presented during the workshop, for those who just want to view the notebooks without running IPython:

+ [Numpy arrays]
* [Plotting] with [Matplotlib]
+ Working with [FITS files]
+ [Fitting] with `lmfit` (one of several packages available)
+ Some useful [Astropy] packages
